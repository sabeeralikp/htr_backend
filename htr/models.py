Module Name: models.py

This module defines the database models for the project.

Models:
- UploadHTR: Represents an uploaded file with associated metadata.
- ThresholdValue: Represents the threshold value and dilate values for image processing.
- AutoSegmentValue: Represents the auto-segmentation values for image processing.
- ImageCordinate: Represents the coordinates and dimensions of an image region.
- SaveData: Represents annotated text and its associated metadata.
- ExportPDF: Represents an exported PDF file.
- HTR: Represents a file with extracted text and associated metadata.

Note: This module assumes the presence of the following packages:
- `datetime`
- `django`
- `django.contrib.auth.models.User`
- `django.db.models`
